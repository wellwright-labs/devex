# pulse

A CLI for developers to run structured self-experiments on their workflow, productivity, and experience.

Define hypotheses, work in time-boxed blocks under different conditions, and collect both subjective (check-ins, reflections) and objective (git metrics) data to evaluate your hypotheses.

While `pulse` ships with a default "AI-assisted coding" experiment template (and is ultimately the original purpose), it is designed to support any workflow experiment: editor changes, work schedule variations, music/environment, methodology shifts, etc.

## roadmap

`pulse` is still in pre-alpha. 

- [ ] Scaffold foundation (confirm tech stack, scaffold repo, get basic CLI tooling running)
- [ ]
- [ ] Add AI observability (e.g. hook into agents and record prompt inputs, timestamp, tokens, etc)
